# GitHub

We heavily rely on GitHub, so everyone should understand the basics in order to best contribute to our repositories. The general idea behind GitHub is to keep track of file changes. This works best with text-based files and not as well with binary files.

### Branches

Each Git repository has at least one branch named `master`. A repository can have more than one branch, and you can create your own. When you make a branch, you basically get a copy of the branch it came from. This allows you to make changes to the repository’s content without disrupting the others’ work. After you make a change, you can merge the branch with another one. Only that difference will be applied to the branch you merge into. This makes it easy to track what’s actually changed and who made the change.

### Pull Requests

It’s possible to push code straight into another branch, but you shouldn’t do it, and in most cases, the master branch will be blocked for such an action. You should create a Pull Request (PR) instead. This action allows anyone to examine your changes. If everything looks good, you can then merge it into the target branch. If not, discuss the changes with the repo owner and continue to make changes until everybody’s happy.

# Markdown

When it comes to wrting text, we format our documents using Markdown, it is a siple way to mark text in a way that it can be esally formated and converted to other formats with ease, while keeping the base document clean and easy to work with.
