This section is for everyone who works at 0x4447. It covers best practices for office life and client communication.

# GitHub

We heavily rely on GitHub, so everyone should understand the basics in order to best contribute to our repositories. The general idea behind GitHub is to keep track of file changes. This works best with text-based files and not as well with binary files.

### Branches

Each Git repository has at least one branch named master. A repository can have more than one master branch, and you can create your own. When you make a branch, you basically get a copy of the branch it came from. This allows you to make changes to the repository’s content without disrupting the others’ work. After you make a change, you can merge the branch with another one. Only that difference will be applied to the branch you merge into. This makes it easy to track what’s actually changed and who made the change.

### Pull Requests

It’s possible to push code straight into another branch, but you shouldn’t do it, and in most cases, the master branch will be blocked for such an action. You should create a Pull Request (PR) instead. This action allows anyone to examine your changes. If everything looks good, you can then merge it into the target branch. If not, discuss the changes with the repo owner and continue to make changes until everybody’s happy.


# How to use BCC in a email conversation

When composing email messages, use the Blind Carbon Copy field in the following ways:

1. Use BCC to keep a third party in the loop without revealing that the person’s name’s been added. For example, when you’re asked to contact someone, adding the individual to the BCC field indicates to that person that you’ve done it. There’s no need to inform that person, either verbally or through any other means.
1. You receive an email introducing you to someone. When you reply to the introductory email, place the name of the person providing the introduction in the BCC to let him or her know that you contacted the person introduced, while also removing the name from any subsequent email exchange. Once the introduction is made, there’s no longer any need to keep the person who made it in the CC.
