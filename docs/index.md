# 📚 Company Foundation

We strongly believe that it’s vital to first build a solid foundation on which to build a bigger ideas, and we make sure everything is easy to understand by anyone. The goal of this repository is to give you an understanding that we’re serious about this and to show you how to work to achieve our goals.

# Good Foundation

Ar 0x4447, LLC. we strongly believe in building a solid foundation before going full speed ahead. We’ve seen over the years that when we’re creating, taking the time to learn the rules, understand problems, and prepare ourselves for the work ahead will save time down the road. I know that it might seem that spending time reading, testing, or thinking might give the impression that not much work is being done. But it’s better to accomplish something while looking as though you’re doing nothing than to take three times longer doing busy work to keep up the appearance that real work is going on.

# The Company Name

Without fail, people are curious about the company name, which is nice because it gives us an excuse to make use of a simple example to explain how computers actually work. 🤓

The numbers 4447 are the initials of the CEO as written in hexadecimal notation, which uses sixteen distinct symbols - from 0 to 9 and from A-F - to represent an integer. So...

- **0x**: tells you that you’re dealing with a [hexadecimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal) number.
- **44**: As a decimal number, 44 becomes 68, which represents the letter D in the [Ascii Table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII).
- **47**: As a decimal number, 47 becomes 71, which represents the letter G in the [Ascii Table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII).

This very nicely shows that a computer’s memory deals solely with numbers. It’s up to you to decide whether you want to represent those numbers as either data or instructions for the CPU. In this case, the position of the numbers within memory tells the computer how to interpret them. When we’re dealing with data instead of instructions, we decide how we want to interpret 68, and we’ve agreed that 68 is D. The letter is displayed on the screen because the font is also tied to that letter in the system. This means that we start with a number, then slowly add layers on top of it until it becomes something meaningful for humans.

# Automation

For us, this is an important part of our forward progression. We love learning new things, find out how things work, and coming up with plans to achieve goals in the most efficient way. But once we do all that, we create a tool that automatically does what we’ve just learned to do. Then we can lock down our knowledge in software everyone can use and learn from.

We can then focus on the next task and continue to build our solid foundation of knowledge and experience. This rule applies to everyone in the company.

We don't believe in repetitive factory-type work. We love to spend our time thinking, creating, and learning in a way that keeps life interesting.

# GitHub

We uses GitHub extensivelly becasue it is flexible, it allows us to keep almost anything there sotred on it. And it gives us the ability to track almost any chagne to the data stored in it (except for the more exotic closed source binary, of course). As a result:

- Our data is nicely backed up.
- We can go back in history and determine why something’s changed.
- Anyone is free to propose a change.
- It’s easy to discuss changes.

GitHub is not limited to programmers; anyone can use it, even designers, administrative work, etc.
