# Designer

Here are some basic rules that every designer needs to know and follow to create a solid image:

- Proportions
- Symmetry
- Rule of Thirds
- Style consistency

# Organization

Be 100 percent organized, take advantage of Layers in your app, give everything a meaningful name, and group Layers into folders to show which ones belong together. You’ll need to be able to go back to any project and instantly know how to change something by looking at the Layer structure. You’ll also want to be mindful of other designers who might make use of your work in the future.

# Automation

The programs you’ll have at your disposal, such as Photoshop, Illustrator, and others, offer built-in tools that allow for the automation of processes. Take the time to learn how to take advantage of them, because once you learn how automation can help you, you’ll be able to work much more quickly. Most importantly, you’ll have more time to spend on creative thinking instead of worrying about how much time you’re going to lose performing some repetitive task that could have been easily automated.
